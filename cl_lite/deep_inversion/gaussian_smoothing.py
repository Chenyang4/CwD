    Apply gaussian smoothing on a

        channels (int, sequence): Number of channels of the input tensors. Output will
            have this number of channels as well.
        kernel_size (int, sequence): Size of the gaussian kernel.
        sigma (float, sequence): Standard deviation of the gaussian kernel.
